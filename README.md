- [Overview](#overview)

For this challenge, we have to build a webpage in which there is an image which has to 
have its background-color changed when getting active, There is also a title which 
color has to be changed when getting active too and aslo a name at the bottom of 
the container. 

  - [The challenge](#the-challenge)
This challenge is about knowing how to put items into their proper places and to 
know more about margins and paddings.

- [My process](#my-process)

For this project, I have defined in the frame meaning the first container the value "auto" 
for the margin-left and margin-right in order to get all the elements of the webpage be 
centered horizontally in the middle of the body.

for the design, I have decided to implement a table of one column and four rows 
by choosing "grid" the value of the display property.
Another task I had to do was to change the background-color of the main image when it is active.
for that, I use the background-blend-mode property and choose the correct value.

line to the desired color.
