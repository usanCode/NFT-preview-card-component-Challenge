## Welcome!

For this project, I have defined in the body the margin and padding properties with the value "auto"
in order to get all the elements of the webpage be centered in the middle.

for the design, I have decided to implement a table of one column and four rows 
by choosing "grid" the value of the display property.
Another task I had to do was to change the background-color of the main image when it is active.
for that, I use the background-blend-mode property and choose the correct value.
